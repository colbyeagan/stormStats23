# This repository is for the Davidson-Davie Basketball Analytics team.

- Currently this repo is an object-oriented python program which can return differenct cumulative statistics for all combinations of N players in a CSV file
- The horrible time complexity in some of the methods is necesarry to iterate through all combinations of N players, that is an inherently expensive operation, no way around it.
